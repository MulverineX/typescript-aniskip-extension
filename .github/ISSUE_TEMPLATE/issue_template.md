**Describe the bug**   
**Setting**: You're in a barbershop, and the barber asks you what's the deal?  
- You say _my hair is too long_, **even though** _it shouldn't be this long_.  
- I say _the automatic anime title detection failed, it always links me to Bunny Girl Senpai (love it tho)_, **even though** _it should be detecting my current anime_.  

**To Reproduce**  
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Go to '...'
2. Click on '....'
3. Scroll down to '....'
4. See error

**Optional, but highly recommended  
1. Update extension
2. Try again
   
**IMPORTANT: If unsure**, say _I think..._, otherwise we would take ages trying to reproduce something that isn't there.  

**Screenshots**  
If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.
